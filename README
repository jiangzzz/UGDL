UGDL is for Unofficial GNU Data Language (GDL)

1. Introduction
---------------

The website of the official GDL is http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/

UGDL 0.0.0 is based on GDL 0.9.6

The purpose of this UGDL is as follows:
  1. to use Git and Github instead of CVS;
  2. to work on it without impacting ongoing GDL development;
  3. not only taken for my C++ hobby, but potentially be used in my Python Data Science related learning or project.

UGDL takes the same license as the original GDL.
All copyright related to UGDL belongs to the author of GDL, i.e. Marc Schellens.

We will try to integrate all new updates of GDL into UGDL.

2. Limitation
-------------

As this is a personal clone of the official GDL, we are only interested in the following platforms:
  * Windows Cygwin;
  * Mac OS.

So some eventual fix for other platforms may not be integrated here. Sorry for that.

3. Procedure
------------

To clone UGDL on your working folder:

$ git clone https://github.com/jiangzzz/UGDL.git
